For this project, I chose to inspect the Project Gutenberg website. I have used this website for finding free, public domain books since I was 12 years old. 

Immediately, it is very clear that the webpage uses html, as shown by the recognizable syntax and the <!DOCTYPE html> at the top of the page.

Furthermore, it also uses css, as shown by many /css tags within the elements.

The home page of the website does not use JavaScript (it is a very simple page), however some of the other pages in the website do. For instance, when viewing the webpage for any individual book, I can see that it uses JavaScript heavily. Due to the formatting of the JavaScript code, I am completely unable to decipher what it is being used for.

Individual book webpages also use XML:

These findings can be confirmed by the Project Gutenberg Github webpage:

This page also reveals that there are 9 different contributers to the website's codebase (though one is a bot), suggesting that only 8 people built/maintain the website.
