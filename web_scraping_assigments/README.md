I chose to scrape the Minecraft fandom wiki.
Here is the link to the robots.txt file: https://minecraft.fandom.com/robots.txt
This page states that I am allowed to scrape data from the site.



I played Minecraft often throughout my childhood and early adolescence. Upon visiting the minecraft fandom page, I was surprised to see that there have been many changes implemented since I last played the game. Most notably, there are several new 'mobs' in the game that I had only dreamed of being implemented: foxes, goats, and dolphins, to name a few. I compiled a list of all mobs new and old.

This list will be interesting to anyone like me, who has not played the game in a while. Furthermore, this list has some surprising entries, as it includes removed, unimplemented, unused, and 'April fools' mobs. Further research might include performing the same scraping on different versions of Minecraft, like Minecraft Bedrock or Minecraft Dungeons.
